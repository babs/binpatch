1.1.0 2008-05-21
------------------
New features:
	  Contributed by Mike Erdely <mike at erdelynet dot com>:
	* Set the CDSRC variable to avoid checking for sys.tar.gz (as is the
	  case when the sources come from the CD).
	* Ability to build multiple kernels.
	* Ability to sign binary patches with gzsig.


	* New target _includes added. Contributed by
	  Mike Erdely <mike at erdelynet dot com>,
	  Lloyd <lloydr at megapathdsl.net> and
	  z0mbix <z0mbix at gmail dot com>

Bugs fixed:
	* Building on macpcc failed because it was looking for the kernel
	  directory "powerpc" instead of "macppc".
	  Fixed by z0mbix <z0mbix at gmail dot com>
